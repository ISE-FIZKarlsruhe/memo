# NFDI4Memory Ontology (MemO)

This repository provides the NFDI4Memory Ontology (MemO) and its documentation. MemO is a domain-specific ontology module developed within the Task Area 3 of the NFDI4Memory initiative. The ontology builds upon the NFDIcore mid-level ontology v3, the NFDI4Culture Ontology v3 and is aligned with the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) 2020 to ensure semantic interoperability and ontological rigor.
