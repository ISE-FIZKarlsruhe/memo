# 4Memory Ontology: Competency Questions

## I. Questions from Researchers’ Perspectives

This document outlines hypothetical competency questions (CQs) to guide the development of the 4Memory ontology. The ontology aims to support the ingestion of research datasets into a knowledge graph, enabling enhanced findability and access to digital records. Content-level queries (e.g. SPARQL) are supported if the data is sufficiently abstracted or generalized.

The ontology is not designed to serve as a generic schema for all historical research data collection. Instead, it addresses intersections between content and metadata, incorporating scientific concepts, established models, and authority data where necessary.

This collection of questions was compiled during a workshop at the Bavarian State Library in Munich in January 2024. Contributors include Florian Grumbach, Arnost Stanzel, Hildegard Schäffler, and Gregor Horstkemper. The adaptation to the usage framework “ontology-based knowledge graph as an index for the 4Memory Data Space” was carried out by Florian Grumbach, Marta Koscielniak, Sarah Ondraszek, Arnost Stanzel, and Tabea Tietz (Sep 2024–Apr 2025). English translation by Sarah Ondraszek.

The term **"information resource"** is used as an umbrella term covering all types of data potentially relevant to the historical sciences.

### General Issues Across Concepts

- Differentiate between metadata (about resources) and content (contained in resources).
- Link data stocks indexed with different classification schemes across archives, libraries, and museums.
- Address alternative names (persons, institutions, places, time periods) using authority data.
- Handle semantic shift and reconcile competing conceptualizations.
- Enable joint use of multiple classifications (e.g. RVK, DDC) for browsing.
- Ensure interoperability with semantic data generated by research.
- Support aggregated search across heterogeneous sources, up to appropriate levels of granularity.
